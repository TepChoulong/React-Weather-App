# Topic: React-Weather-App

## Details:

A weather application is a very good beginner-level react project. You can create this using a free API from OpenWeather. Create a weather application where the user needs to enter the state name and as a result, your application will show the temperature and the weather condition on the user interface. Though you can show other things too like date, month, year, etc. You are going to get all the weather details from the weather API, the API automatically updates with the weather condition.
